      "The primary function of any tire is to transfer a vehicle's load from the axle through the wheel to the ground and to provide consistent traction. Most modern tires, like those for passenger cars, are pneumatically inflated structures, which provide a flexible cushion. This absorbs shock as the tire rolls over rough features on the surface. We must always check the inflation pressure.",

      "The composition is critical. Modern pneumatic tires are typically a composite of synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric, and steel wire. They consist primarily of two major parts: the tread, which provides traction, and the body or carcass, which provides containment for a quantity of compressed air. Tire dimensions, such as aspect ratio, directly affect performance.",

      "Let's focus on the tread pattern. The tread is the part of a tire that contacts the road surface. Its pattern is designed to serve multiple purposes: improving water drainage, providing optimal traction for braking and cornering, and aiding in NVH (Noise, Vibration, and Harshness) performance. Adequate tread depth prevents aquaplaning at higher speeds. The shoulder helps dissipate heat.",

      "Regarding selection codes, when choosing tires, you must account for factors that impact performance, such as speed rating (S, T, U, H, V, W, Y) and load coefficient. Higher speed codes often correlate with better quality materials and higher heat tolerance. This is why tire classification is highly regulated for passenger safety. Always check the sidewall codes.",

      "The carcass, or body, is the load-bearing framework composed of rubber-coated fabric laid in a radial direction. The inner liner is a special rubber layer with high resistance to air migration, replacing the old inner tubes used before the 1950s. The bead anchors the tire to the wheel rim, supporting the carcass.",
